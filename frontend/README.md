This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Environmental variables
This project utilizes Firebase as the Identity Provider. In order to set up the application properly, you need to add Firebase config to the environmental variables.
Copy the `env.template` file and rename to `.env`. Then, you can put the values of the secrets there. The `.env` file is gitignored. 

Then, you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
